description: The saga of a SRE sharing his technological adventures

`Howdy` is how I typically start my conversations. It can serve as a
greeting as well as a somewhat icebreaker.

So... howdy! Ice broken yet?

Well, first things first, my name is André Nogueira and I'm an Site Reliability
Engineer (SRE). If you are interested in my work history, my LinkedIn profile
as well as my resume will be linked in the [Contact](../contact) page.

I've been an _aficionado_ for all things tech since I can remember. From a very
young age, I've been fascinated with games and consequently with computers.
I've also been lucky enough to be exposed to a lot of creativity-related games,
especially LEGO, which I believe helped me pioneer my problem-solving skills.

Assembling and disassembling things has always been a great interest of mine,
and that's exactly what ended up attracting me the most in the world of
technology.

That curiosity and passion is still very much alive in me, the desire to know
how things work, how they communicate with each other, how they can be
automated, how they can be improved and how they can be secured have probably
been the main driver that lead me to this path that I'm currently on, being a
SRE.

Recently, I've began to feel the urge to share some of the knowledge that I've
been gathering over the years, and that's the main reason behind this blog. Not
just about sharing, but also about constructing something, so I thought:
_Why not combine both and build something and share it with the world?_ That
thought has been stuck in my mind for a while now, and, if you are reading
this, it means I've finally decided to take the leap and start this journey.

You may be wonder the reason behind the name of this blog. If you aren't,
well... I'll explain it anyway. I'm always curious about all the **lore**
behind the things I'm interested in or I follow. Like I previously mentioned,
this blog has been something that I've been thinking for a while now (won't
mention how long, but it's been a while...) and one of the main reasons that
made me take so long to start it was: what should I actually name it?

Naming anything is hard. If you are a fellow DevOps you might relate to that,
and if you don't relate to that, I envy you. So for some time I've been
brainstorming a lot with my inner self a potential good name for this blog.
I knew the kind of content I wanted to share (which was stuff about
technology), but the actual content was still an uncertainty. As I've mentioned
before, I enjoy a variety of fields in technology, so I knew that the name
would need to be something that could encompass as many of them as possible.

After spamming my girlfriend with potential names, as a joke she said: "Why not
call it `Tech Quests`?". At first I laughed it off, but it got stuck in my head
and I realized it actually filled up all the criteria I had in mind. It was
vague enough, it mentioned technology, it was somewhat catchy and had a nice
ring to it. On top of it I though it was **me**, as in, it reflected my journey
and the approach I typically take when learning and exploring new things. I
tend to look at each task/project as a quest of sorts, kind of like a RPG game,
where you have a main quest but also a bunch of side quests for you to explore.
Here, there's not really going to be a main quest, just a bunch of side quests,
because the goal is not to reach a final place - a destination -, but to enjoy
the journey as I explore, build and share all the things that I'll be learning
throughout.

With that being said, if you reach this point, I thank you for taking the time
to read all of this, out of all the things that you could be doing right now,
and I hope you enjoy the many side (_tech_) quests that we'll be embarking on.
