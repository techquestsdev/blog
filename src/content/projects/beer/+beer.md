Howdy!

What started as a joke turned into a fully functional app - built in just a few
hours for a **Futsal tournament where tracking drink consumption per team was
essential**.

A friend said, "We need to keep score of who's drinking more." I said, "Say no
more."

Enter: **Beer: Contador de Bebidas** - a dead-simple, no-frills web app to
**count drinks per team**.

## The Rules Are Simple

- Add a team
- Click to count drinks 🍻
- Made a mistake? You can **decrement**, but not delete teams
- Why? Because _drunk deletions are real_ - this is a safe zone
- Want to reset? Open your browser dev tools and poke at `Local Storage`

No sign-in, no backend, no cloud magic - just good ol' browser persistence and
a clean UI. Refresh, come back later, and your drink history lives on.

## Tech Stack

Built with:

- **Next.js** (for speed of setup)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for quick styling)
- **TypeScript** (because I actually like type safety now)
- **localStorage** (because that's all we needed)

Clean. Friendly. Functional. Slightly buzzed.

## Why It Exists

Honestly? To have fun, practice a bit, and solve a very niche problem in the
most over-engineered yet under-engineered way possible.

It might not change the world, but it definitely helped a group of friends
**turn a Futsal tournament into a social experiment in beer economics**.

That's it. No real roadmap. But hey, maybe a leaderboard next time?

Until then, enjoy responsibly 🍺
